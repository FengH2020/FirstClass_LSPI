# FirstClass_LSPI
This is my first Python programm which is created for the implementation of the Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) reinforcement learning algorithm. 
For more information on the algorithm please refer to the paper

“Least-Squares Policy Iteration.”

This programm code mainly refers to Devin's project 
https://pythonhosted.org/lspi-python/index.html

However, some mistakes have been found therein based on the knowlege that I have got before. So, I have rewritten this project accroding to my understanding at that time.
