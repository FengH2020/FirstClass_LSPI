# FirstClass_LSPI
This is my first Python programm which is created for the implementation of the Least Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) reinforcement learning algorithm. 
For more information on the algorithm please refer to the paper

“Least-Squares Policy Iteration.”

This programm code mainly comes from Devin's project 
https://pythonhosted.org/lspi-python/index.html

However, the following changes have been done according to the knowledge that I have got before:
1) some mistakes have been found and revised accordingly
2) some methods (functions) have been rewritten in a properer way
